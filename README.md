### JavaScript Boilerplate Project

This is a simple boilerplate project for you to get started with `TDD in JavaScript`.

#### Up and Running

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:abruzzi/js-boilerplate.git my-proj
$ cd my-proj
$ npm install
$ karma start #if this fails, pleae make sure you have `karma` 
```

The `karma start` will have Chrome launched, and karma is listening the file changes you made, and then run the tests if any changes occured.

Then you can write tests in `spec` folder end withs `-spec.js`, and write your implementation in folder `src`.
